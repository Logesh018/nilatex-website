I need your help in modifying my code.

Currently I am building a website for a client.



The issue is I written all the styles in the "index.css" file.

There is no issue but index.css already reached 700 lines and I am only finished 2 sections Hero and Products.

There are plenty more and the index.css is only going to get bigger which will hard to maintain in the future.



What I want is:

Tailwind in JSX for all component-specific styles. Keep index.css only for what Tailwind can't do — CSS variables, keyframe animations, and the truly global navbar/hero classes that are already there.



So all of our styles will be the same but it is written in JSX so that it is easy to maintain.



I will share you the files.
Think deeply and adjust & modify the code.
The most important rule "The UI, padding, colors and everything has to be the same. It's just that it is written in a different way which is easy to maintain.
